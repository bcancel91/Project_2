## Introduction - the project's aim
This app was developed with the idea to help other learn code in a modern and simple way. Ideally we have to types of users, which would be instructors and students. Both users share the same platform. The app is designed so that users (instrutors) looking to showcase and practice their skills can post a class that they know that they can teach others. The other users (students) would be able to browse through classes posted by the users registered as instructors. We are designing the app to have a few parameters before a post can be succssful.

The app has a an area with commonly used resourses that can be accessed by a click.
